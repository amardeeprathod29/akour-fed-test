## Description of my solution

The Webpage been built by us represents the details of the team members working with the firm. This Webpage could be part of any website that represents a company across any industry since each of these websites usually have a webpage dedicated to the team members. 
The Webpage titled ‘Meet the Team’, fetches the data from RandomUser.me API and displays 5 user cards at the start. It also has a load more button at the bottom of the page which can fetch another 5 user cards for each click. Each card displays following information of team member:
•	Name
•	Picture
•	Phone Number
•	Email address
•	Address
The tech stack been used to accomplish this is:
•	HTML
•	CSS (Media Query)
•	Java Script
•	ReactJS


## Things I would do next

Initially I had built this application using HTML/CSS and Jscript with all the above-mentioned features as per the instructions in email/ReadMe file. However, while uploading the code to GIT, I noticed the file/folder structure of cloned repository looked more aligned to ReactJS hence I started to add ReactJS in the code. Due to last minute addition, I was not able to complete the application feature of “Load More” hence my next logical step would have been addition of that feature in the code.
I am committing two code bases in the GIT:
1.	Application(TeamCard) not using ReactJS but having all the features mentioned.
2.	Application using ReactJS but not having the load more feature.


## Assumptions that I made

There were certain assumptions that I have made while building this application. They are:
1.	There were certain other attributes that were exposed in API such as Date of Birth, Latitude and Longitude etc. I have not included this information in the card since this seemed like a personal information (PI) that might not be proper to be displayed publicly. Address was another such attribute that might come under same category, but I have added it in application for now since certain business use case might need this information.
